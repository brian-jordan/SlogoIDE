SLogo API Design 


* **When does parsing need to take place and what does it need to start properly?** 
     Parsing needs to take place as soon as the user types a command and hits enter. All it needs to start properly is that the command be typed following proper Logo syntax. The Window to display the results of executing the command (as well as the backend logic to process and execute that command) need to be ready and initialised to execute that command.





* **What is the result of parsing and who receives it?**
    The result of parsing is the Logo commands being converted into a series of actions/parameters that can be passed by the View classes to the back_end classes for execution.
    
    
* **When are errors detected and how are they reported?**
    The errors are detected by the parser when it parses a user-entered command. If any errors are generated by the back_end classes while executing the parsed commands, the errors must be caught by the View classes and appropriately displayed to the user/developer for debugging. Likewise, when information is returning from the back_end to the view, the parser again ensures that valid information is being passed. 
    
* **What do commands know, when do they know it, and how do they get it?**
    The commands (if defined as the Logo commands entered by the user) don't know anything at all. The parser will decide what actions have to be taken based on the command, and will pass that information to the backend classes to be executed. These classes know this information as soon as the parser passes it to them. The get it using a public API that is accessed by the parser to pass in this information.

* **How is the GUI updated after a command has completed execution?**
    When the backend completes execution of a command, it will update the new position of the turtle and return a boolean signifying the success (or the lack therof) of a certain command. Based on this return value, the frontend classes will then update the position of the turtle on the screen and draw the connecting lines between the previous and current turtle-position (if the turtle was down on the screeen).
    
    
## Use Cases

* **The user types 'fd 50' in the command window, sees the turtle move in the display window leaving a trail, and has the command added to the environment's history.**
    The GUI responds to an enter press after 'fd 50' is typed and passes that command to a parser. The parser determines that the action to be taken is `MOVE_FORWARD` and the amount is `50`, and passes this information back to the frontend, which passes it to the Processor object. The Processor object executes the action and updates its local variables to reflect the turtles new position and previous position and whether it drew a trail to get there (yes, for this case). The frontend obtains these three values and moves the turtle to the new position whilst drawing a line between these two points.
    * Method calls involved:
        * `parseCommand()` - Called by the GUI
        * `executeCommand()` - Called by the GUI if `parseCommand` executes successfully.
        * `getCurrentPosition()`, `getPreviousPosition()`, `isPenTracing()` - Called by the GUI if `executeCommand` executes successfully.
        * `draw()` - Private method within the frontend class to execute the actual act of drawing based on parameters obtained in the previous step.



* **The user types '50 fd' in the command window and sees an error message that the command was not formatted correctly.**
    The GUI responds to an enter press after ‘fd 50’ is typed and passes that command to a parser. The parser determines that the command entered is invalid and returns `false` back to the frontend which then displays an error message.
    
    * Method calls involved:
        * `parseCommand()` - Called by the GUI
        * `displayError()` - Called by the GUI after failing `parseCommand()`


* **The user types 'pu fd 50 pd fd 50' in the command window and sees the turtle move twice (once without a trail and once with a trail).**
    The GUI responds to an enter press after 'fd 50 pd fd 50' is typed and passes that command to a parser.  The parser seperates the line into the 3 seperate command objects.  These command objects are then passed to the backend and executed in order.
    
    * Method calls involved:
        * `parseCommand()` - Called by the GUI
        * `createAction()` - Called by Parser
        * `executeActions()` - Called by GUI

* **The user changes the color of the environment's background.**
    The GUI responds to an enter press after the command is typed and passes that command to a parser. These command objects are then passed to the backend and executed in order.
    
    * Method calls involved:
        * `parseCommand()` - Called by the GUI
        * `createAction()` - Called by Parser
        * `executeActions()` - Called by GUI
